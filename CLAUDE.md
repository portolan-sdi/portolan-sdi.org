# Portolan Website

## Identity

**Portolan** is a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) toolkit and set of conventions for publishing geospatial data as cloud-native files on object storage. It is **not** a hosting service — Portolan does not host data. It is open source, openly governed, and free.

Key framing words: **open · sovereign · AI-ready · cheap · cloud-native**.

Avoid framing Portolan as a SaaS, a portal, a product, or a company.

## Visual System (non-negotiable)

The system is **editorial / utility**: warm near-monochrome paper, a single
disciplined blue accent, distinctive grotesque type, generous whitespace, and
**hairline rules instead of cards**. No gradients, no drop shadows, no soft bands.

- **Type:** Hanken Grotesk (sans, Latin text) + JetBrains Mono (code, labels, eyebrows, kickers) + Cairo (all Arabic text). No other fonts in production.
- **Color tokens:** Use CSS variables from `globals.css`. Never hardcode hex except in SVG and fixed-dark terminal/map blocks.
- **Palette:** warm cream paper (`--p-bg: #fcfcfa`) and near-black ink (`--p-ink: #16170f`) with a **single blue accent** — `--p-primary: #1b4dd1` (== `--p-accent`; the old gold is retired). Dark mode is a warm-dark editorial palette (`--p-bg: #141410`, accent `#7d97ff`).
- **Type scale (single source of truth):** Use the named utilities generated from `--text-*` tokens in `globals.css`, never arbitrary sizes like `text-[13px]`. Available: `text-eyebrow`, `text-micro`, `text-small`, `text-body`, `text-body-lg`, `text-lead`, `text-card-title`, `text-card-title-lg`, `text-feature`, `text-section-sm`, `text-section`, `text-hero`, `text-hero-sm`. Headings and lead text are fluid via `clamp()`.
- **Corners are near-square.** `--p-r-md` (3px) for buttons/inputs, `--p-r-lg` (4px) for content blocks. Nothing is pill-shaped.
- **Surfaces are flat.** Shadow tokens render as `none` / a single hairline — never a glassy drop shadow. Separate content with hairline borders (`border-p-line`, `border-p-line-strong`), not cards or soft background bands. **At most one** subtle `--p-bg-soft` band on the page (the talks section).
- **Section kickers:** mono, `text-p-ink-3`, the label string only. No `NN ·` index prefixes (numbers are reserved for real sequences like the how-it-works steps), no `// EYEBROW` punctuation, no uppercase, no wide tracking.
- **Terminal blocks** are driven by the `--term-*` tokens (chrome) and `--term-syntax-*` tokens (line colors), and **track the light/dark theme** — a warm paper code block in light mode, warm near-black in dark. Pass line colors as `var(--term-syntax-*)` references, never raw hex, so they flip with the theme. The chrome is a plain mono title bar — **no macOS traffic-light dots**.
- **Logo:** Two-pennant SVG in `PortolanLogo`, rendered in a **solid** `--p-primary` fill — no gradient.

## Layout & Responsiveness

- **Mobile-first, always.** Start from the single-column small-screen layout, then add `sm:` / `md:` / `lg:` breakpoints. Never write a desktop-only layout.
- **Section padding:** sections use `px-[var(--p-pad-section-x)]` and `py-[var(--p-pad-section-y)]` (fluid `clamp()` tokens). Do not use the fixed `--p-pad-xl` for section padding.
- **Grids collapse:** multi-column grids start at `grid-cols-1` and step up (for example `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`).
- **Shared chrome:** the header and footer come from `SiteHeader` and `SiteFooter`. Do not inline `<header>` / `<footer>` markup in pages. The header carries the mobile hamburger drawer. The header is solid `--p-bg` with a hairline — no frosted `backdrop-blur`. Nav stays minimal (Registry, Docs, GitHub as text links; no same-page table-of-contents anchors). The footer carries the colophon and real links — never dead spans that look like links.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16+ App Router with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (pure utilities, no `@apply`)
- next-intl for i18n (English default, Spanish at `/es/`)
- pnpm for package management
- Deploying to Vercel at portolan-sdi.org

## What NOT to do

- Don't add a "mission" or "about" section to the homepage
- Don't reintroduce the install button in the header
- Don't add emoji (except Unicode marks: ↗, →, ·)
- Don't add icons to nav items
- Don't introduce CSS-in-JS libraries
- Don't add filler content
- Don't use arbitrary font-size values (`text-[13px]`); use the type scale
- Don't inline header/footer markup; use `SiteHeader` / `SiteFooter`
- Don't reintroduce the "AI-y" look: gradient text/fills, gradient or shadowed buttons, glassy drop shadows, rounded bento cards, pill-shaped tags, circular status dots, `// EYEBROW` labels, or soft alternating background bands.
- Don't reintroduce the second-wave "AI-y" tells removed in the bespoke pass: typewriter/rotating hero headlines, `NN ·` numbered section kickers, numbers on non-sequence card grids, macOS traffic-light dots on terminals, stacked big-number hero stat blocks (live stats render as one mono log-line), or a frosted translucent header.
- Don't propose or reintroduce the rhumb-line / compass-rose motif in any form — tried repeatedly, explicitly rejected.
- Don't give every card in a grid identical anatomy (number + title + body + tag); ragged is deliberate.

## i18n

- Default locale: English (no URL prefix)
- Spanish: `/es/` prefix · Arabic: `/ar/` prefix (RTL)
- Translation files in `messages/` (`en.json`, `es.json`, `ar.json`)
- Use `useTranslations` hook in client components

### Translation contract (required)

- Every user-facing string lives in `messages/`. Never hardcode copy in components.
- When you add or change a string, update **all three** files (`en`, `es`, `ar`) under
  the **same key**. Key sets must stay identical across locales.
- Follow `docs/i18n/glossary.md`. Keep product and format names (Portolan, STAC,
  GeoParquet, COG, S3, ...) in Latin in every locale.
- Digits are always Latin (0-9), including in Arabic.
- No em dashes, colons, or semicolons in Spanish or Arabic copy.

### RTL rules (Arabic)

- Use Tailwind **logical** utilities in shared UI (`ps/pe`, `ms/me`, `text-start/end`,
  `border-s/e`, `rounded-s/e`, `inset-s/e`), never physical `pl/pr/ml/mr/left/right`.
  Prefer `gap-*` over `space-x-*`.
- Reserve `rtl:` variants for mirroring directional icons (use `<DirArrow>`).
- Never mirror the logo, the map/dither canvas, or terminal/code blocks. Terminal and
  code blocks stay `dir="ltr"`.
- Wrap pure-Latin standalone values (names, versions, license, repo) in `<Ltr>` so they
  stay correctly ordered inside Arabic text.
- Arabic always renders in Cairo (Archivo has no Arabic glyphs). On RTL pages the
  `--p-sans` token re-points to Cairo in `globals.css`, so body, headings, and the
  `font-sans` utility all resolve to Cairo. Cairo is also the Arabic-glyph fallback in
  the base sans stack, so stray Arabic on an LTR page (for example the language switcher)
  still renders Cairo. Never hardcode `font-family`, rely on the tokens.
- `<html lang dir>` is set per locale in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` via
  `getDirection(locale)`. Do not reintroduce `<html>` into the root layout.
